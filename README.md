Hi, I am Praveen Rao V P.
I am an aspiring Android Developer, with skillsets based on Core Java, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and XML Views.
I have worked on projects utilizing Retrofit, Room Database, and Remote Databases such as Firebase.
I continuously aim to develop my skillsets consistently and I am open to work for a company which values my skillsets and provide me with a platform to develop myself, while I prove to be indispensable and my work proves to be profitable to the firm I am working in.
